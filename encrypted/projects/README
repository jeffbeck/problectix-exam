The files (project,problem) are found ONLY if there are in a certain location.
This avoids pairing a problem with the wrong project

A problem file can be used only in ONE project 
(The project with the name of the directory the problem is in)

A) ONE subdirectory with the name <projectname>
B) ONE project description file <projectname>/<projectname>.tex
   loaded with \inputproject{<projectname>}
C) Multiple Aufgaben files <projectname>/<your_name>.tex
   loaded with \inputproblem{<your_name>}
   (Aufgaben files are only found in the <projectname> subdirectory)
